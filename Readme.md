# Todo List Project 

## Introduction

Hello amazing developer üëã,

Here's the project that I referred to my [blog](https://dev.to/suchintan/javascript-to-typescript-complete-guide-with-react-1nd8)

This is a small Todo-List project which was made to help you understand , how you can change a project from **JavaScript** to **TypeScript**.

Hope you will enjoy it !

## Start Project

Here's the step you have to follow to start the project -

1. Open one terminal and navigate to `cd client` of the project .
2. Use `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the react project.
3. Open another terminal and navigate to `cd server` of the project.
4. Use `npm install` and then `node app.js` to start the express server.
5. You frontend will be running on `localhost:3000` and backend on `localhost:5000`.

## What's there on the repository

As through the blog I explained a lot of syntaxes and a whole project. You will find a folder with all the `syntaxes` , a `client` side with the react app with typescript and at last `server` side for the express server on which we are making the calls.

## Stacks of the project

**Frontend**:
1. **React**
2. **TypeScript**
3. **Axios**
